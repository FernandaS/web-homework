# Divvy Front End Homework Reflecion

<br />

## Objectives completed

- I wrote a basic user inerface that allows users to enter, edit, and remove transactions.

  - Also included users data model to transaction

- Created a context where user can convert the displayed numbers to Roman Numerals. By using a context, I was able to persist state across pages.

- Seeded the DB using a script to initialize application with a user and 5 transactions.

- Added an i18n setting Via URL (eg `?i18n=true`). Created a `LinkWithSearch` component that maintains current search query params across page transitions.

- Added Material UI component for:

  - better navigation
  - improved styling

- multiple routes with content (dashboard, transactions)

- converted material UI styles to emotioncss by passing the theme

## Successes

- Beautiful and working application with few working days.

- Deeper dive into React after some time working with web components.

- First time working with GraphQL and seeing the benefits it would bring to a team.

## Challenges

- Like with any new job, ramping up on the technologies used, as well as their older versions, took some time to understand.

- Writing tests was challeging due to how contexts work. Also, figuring out how to use a different testing library added to the challenge.

- Learning GraphQL, Apollo, and their implementation was different. I was accustomed to thinking in terms of `GET/PUT/POST/DELETE`, not `Query` and `Mutation`.

- Converting all styles from material UI to emotioncss. There was a learning curve to how to make these technologies play together.

**This project was a lot of fun!! I've learned so much while doing this.**
